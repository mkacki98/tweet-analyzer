### Installation

If you want to play around with the code yourself, create a fresh environment with pip/conda. My environment was running Python `3.8.10` on Linux (CPU).

`git clone git@github.com:mkacki98/tweet-analyzer.git`

`python -m venv .venv`

`source .venv/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`
