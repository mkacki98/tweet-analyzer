# Tweet Analyser

This is a Streamlit web application that does a simple analysis of tweets from a given account. The app is hosted on Streamlit cloud and you can access it here:

`https://mkacki98-tweet-analyzer-app-3ynagl.streamlit.app/`.


### Installation

If you want to play around with the code yourself, create a fresh environment with pip/conda. My environment was running Python `3.8.10` on Linux (CPU).

`git clone git@github.com:mkacki98/tweet-analyzer.git`

`python -m venv .venv`

`source .venv/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
