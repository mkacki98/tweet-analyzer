# Todo

- Add something to say "this nickname doesn't exist, pick something else"
- Add buttons, so that we can seamlessly change between different nicknames.
* Rearrange the plots to be on two columns and change them to black background
* Add likes overview - e.g. return the most liked Tweet 
* Make sure the sentiment analyser works well, perhaps use a different one.
* Add WordCloud of the most common nouns.

- How can I add the model/data somewhere, so it doesn't have to download it each time?
    -- added st.cache(), should work

* Add docstrings everywhere, pass it through linting and formatter.
* Deploy the model with the Streamlit cloud.
