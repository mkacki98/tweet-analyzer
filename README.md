# Tweet Analyser

This is a Streamlit web application that does a simple analysis of tweets from a given account. The app is hosted on Streamlit cloud and you can access it here:

`https://mkacki98-tweet-analyzer-app-3ynagl.streamlit.app/`.

Note that Streamlit freezes the app if it doesn't receive calls for 5 days. It may take a few minutes to run the app if it has been frozen.

### Installation

If you want to play around with the code yourself, create a fresh environment with pip/conda. My environment was running Python `3.8.10` on Linux (CPU).

```

python -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
